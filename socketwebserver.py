# Single-threaded Web Server with Request-Line Logging
# CS 538 Project 1 â€” Single-Threaded Web Server (Port 7755)
# Author: Ampomah Kofi
# CWID: 12504602
# Description: This server implements a basic HTTP/1.1 web server using Python sockets.
#              It listens on port 7755, parses simple GET requests, serves static files
#              from the current directory (with MIME type detection for browser rendering),
#              and returns 404 for missing files. Supports text/binary files (e.g., HTML, images,
#              videos, plain text). Logs request lines and responses to console for debugging.
#              Aligns with assignment: single-threaded, command-line execution, browser testing
#              on 127.0.0.1:7755, no backend outputs in screenshots except CLI start.

server_socket = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM)

# Allow socket reuse to avoid "Address already in use" errors on restart

# Bind to all interfaces ('') on the specified port (listen on localhost for testing)
server_socket.bind(('', PORT))
